# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
start the program
### Step 2: 
Assign the values for the variables x1,x2,y1,y2
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG)
### Step 4: 
print distance using format to display the answer with two decimal points
### Step 5: 
End the program
### PROGRAM:
  #Program to find the distance between two points.

a=[10,6]
b=[4,2]
d=((b[0]-a[0])**2+(b[1]-a[1])**2)**0.5
print("{:.2f}".format(d))


### OUTPUT:
